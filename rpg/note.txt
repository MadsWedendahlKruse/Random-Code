MAKE EVERYTHING INTO VERTICES INSTEAD OF SPRITES!!!

Button class almost seems a bit redundant. 
Pretty much all of its functionanlity is included in the base UIElement class. 
The only addition is that it draws a label in the middle of the button.
Maybe the whole clicking thing should be moved to the button class?
On the other hand it's quite convenient to have it in the ButtonList so that it can just pass the click on to the correct button.
